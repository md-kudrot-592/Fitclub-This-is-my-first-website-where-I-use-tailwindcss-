# Fitclub - Tailwind CSS Project

🚀 This is my first full project using **Tailwind CSS**!

After learning the basic concepts from tutorials, I jumped into this real-world project. Throughout the journey, I used **AI as my personal teacher** — asking questions, solving problems, and learning Tailwind practically.

💡 What I’ve learned so far:
- Utility-first workflow
- Responsive layouts
- Flexbox & Grid systems
- Custom color schemes
- Icon integration with Remix Icon
- Typography and spacing
- Mobile-first design

🎯 I'm still working on final touches, but happy with the current result.  
**Tailwind feels easy to use — especially if you’re already confident with CSS.**
